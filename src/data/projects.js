        fullDescription: `This project looks for traces of dancing in the ongoing "Woman, Life, Freedom" revolution in Iran from an AI generative lens to add a layer of meaning, symbolism, and visual aesthetics. The revolution centers around the reclamation of bodily agency, particularly for women, used as a tool of oppression, such as mandatory hijab, criminalizing dance and singing for women, and body-imposed punishments such as public lashing, and execution. The revolution's symbols revolve around the body, including women's hair, dancing, and public displays of affection. The video footage used in the installation is curated from the many social media videos of people dancing in public spaces, including the iconic Azadi Square in Tehran, to show resilience through their bodies. The dancers represent a diverse range of marginalized bodies, including women, queer dancers, disabled bodies, Kurd and Baloch ethnic groups, and women wearing different levels of hijab representing various religious beliefs. The dancers' anonymity is protected for their safety, as some identified dancers have been arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison for dancing for only ten seconds. The different dance styles showcased in the videos, from hip-hop to ballet and sophism, all unite in their demand for freedom.`,

        description: 'Visualizing stories of resilience through embodied martyred portraits. This project showcases the stories of the Iranian revolution through the use of text-to-image generative AI tools.',
        fullDescription: `Visualizing stories of resilience through embodied martyred portraits. In September 2022, the death of #Mahsa_Amini by the Islamic Republic Morality Police initiated the first female-led revolution in Iran with the motto “Woman, Life, Freedom”. This project showcases the stories of the Iranian revolution through the use of text-to-image generative AI tools. The images are created by collaging different sections together to form a silhouette of each person who sacrificed their lives for freedom. The collection was created through research-creation with the aim of advocating against political injustice and amplifying the voices of those fighting in the ongoing revolution in Iran. Using stories, narratives, and visions from the revolution, we transformed these into visually striking images using text-to-image generative AI systems. The images illustrate the protests on the streets and elements from each person's story, forming a powerful and symbolic tribute to the martyrs and freedom fighters. Our hope is that this collection inspires greater awareness and support for those who continue to fight for a better future in Iran.`,

        fullDescription: `AI art installation for interpreting and visualizing a scene. White clouds in blue sky is a three-channel video installation by artist-anthropologists Kate Hennessy and Trudi Lynn Smith in collaboration with artist and artificial intelligence scholar Steve DiPaola, edited by J Tseng and AI system support by Amineh Ahmadi Nejad. The first video channel includes Henesey and Smith bringing chairs and mundane objects to an empty scene and constructing a sculpture that is covered up at the end by a white panel. Using DenseCap machine vision and description system, every frame of the video is captioned. The second channel of the video shows poetic texts representing descriptions of the video. The captions are visualized using GAN and CLIP systems to generate images representing the texts (third channel). The soundtrack is yet another AI-generated response to the performance-initiated texts.`,

Alice falling down the rabbit hole, infinite zoom video, AI-generated.

"It was a warm summer day
And Alice was getting bored sitting by her sister
who had her nose buried in a book
he shook his head, then disappeared into the rabbit hole
'I must find out why he's in such a hurry', cried Alice
'When will I reach the bottom of this dreadful hole', she said
This key must fit one of the doors, she said
'But I'm too big to fit through such a little door, maybe the potion on the table will help'
And she drank it"
